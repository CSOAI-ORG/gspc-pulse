# GSPC Live Pulse — public measurement evidence

An append-only series of public-surface observations from the Council of AI's
GSPC lane. It is **measurement, not endorsement, certification or a safety
verdict**. Missing source data is not silently converted to zero.

## Dataset Viewer

- **`pulse-jsonl`** — nested, per-pulse observations with source timestamps,
  runner identity and ecosystem evidence.
- **`pulse-timeseries`** — flat numeric/string counters suitable for pandas,
  R, spreadsheets and time-series analysis.

Both configurations are explicit so the Hub viewer can build rows rather than
showing an empty dataset. `pulse.jsonl` and `timeseries.csv` must have the same
number of observations; `feed.json` and `latest.json` bind to the same final row.

## Provenance and verification

`pulse-freeze-manifest.json`, `pulse-leaves.json` and
`pulse-freeze-manifest.sig` commit to exactly the first `n_rows` records in
`pulse.jsonl`. Those rows form the **Ed25519-signed prefix**. The hourly public
GitHub Actions watcher has no private signing key; later observations may be
appended as an **unsigned tail**. The tail is not covered by the signature and
must not be described as verified. `DIGEST.md` and `mirror-receipt.json` state
the current signed-prefix and unsigned-tail counts.

Verify the signed prefix using the source repository's `pulse_freeze.py`:

```bash
python3 pulse_freeze.py verify
python3 pulse_freeze.py prove --ts 2026-11-07T12:06:40Z
```

`verify` reports any unsigned tail. `verify --require-full` exits non-zero
unless every row is signed. `prove --ts` accepts only timestamps in the signed
prefix. A successful prefix verification does **not** authenticate later rows.
The manifest is signature-frozen, not ledger-frozen; OTS/Rekor/XRPL anchoring
remains owner-gated.

## Sources and method

The pulse samples the public GSPC board, measurement-capsule index, public root,
signed-card index, Hugging Face model ecosystem, CISA KEV, and public MCP/x402
surfaces. Each observation carries its own source timestamps and runner. The
public watcher is independent HTTP reproduction, not an authoritative GSPC
measurement or a model inference run.
